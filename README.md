# GGREP
## Go implemented grep

Since I don't know grep alternatives on Windows, I wrote this grep *like* tool 
mainly to use it on Windows. But since it's in Go, it sure can run on 
Linux as well.

It's grep *like* because it shares the same purpose, but it's never the aim to 
make it grep compatible. The aim is to make it usable and feature-rich. And 
fast when the first two aims are achieved.
